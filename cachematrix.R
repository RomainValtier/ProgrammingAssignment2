## A pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
## makeMatrix creates a special "matrix", which is a list containing a function to
##      set the value of the matrix
##      get the value of the matrix
##      set the value of the solve
##      get the value of the solve


makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        m <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                m <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setsolve <- function(solve) m <<- solve
        getsolve <- function() m
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setsolve = setsolve,
             getsolve = getsolve)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above.
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed),
## then cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        m <- x$getsolve()
        if(!is.null(m)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(m)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        m <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setsolve(m)
        m
}
